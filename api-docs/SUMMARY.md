# API Documentation Summary

## Overview

The Risk Assessment API is designed to evaluate the potential risk associated with user login attempts based on various factors such as geographical location, device fingerprinting, and historical login data. This API aims to enhance security by assessing the threat level of each login attempt and providing insights into potential anomalies.

## Key Features

- **GeoIP Assessment**: Analyzes the geographical location of the user's IP address and compares it with the user's last known location to determine any discrepancies that may indicate a potential threat.

- **Device Fingerprinting**: Utilizes device-specific information, such as user agent and IP address, to create a unique fingerprint for each device. This fingerprint is then compared with the last known device used by the user to identify any unauthorized access attempts.

- **Threat Level Calculation**: The API calculates a threat level based on various criteria, including changes in geographical location and device fingerprint. The threat level is incremented based on the severity of the discrepancies found.

## Endpoints

- **Risk Assessment Endpoint**: Detailed documentation for this endpoint can be found in [risk-assessment.md](endpoints/risk-assessment.md). This includes information on request and response formats, parameters, and usage examples.

## Conclusion

The Risk Assessment API provides a robust mechanism for enhancing security during user authentication processes. By leveraging geographical and device data, it helps in identifying potential threats and ensuring safer user experiences.

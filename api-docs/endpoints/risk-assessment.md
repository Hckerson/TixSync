# Risk Assessment API Documentation

## Overview
The Risk Assessment API provides functionality to evaluate the threat level associated with user login attempts based on various factors such as geographical location, device fingerprinting, and IP address. This service is designed to enhance security by identifying potentially suspicious login activities.

## Endpoint
### POST /risk-assessment

#### Description
This endpoint assesses the risk level of a user attempting to log in by analyzing their geographical data and device fingerprint. It returns a threat level score based on discrepancies between the current login attempt and the user's last known data.

#### Request Format
The request must be a JSON object containing the following fields:

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
}
```

- **email** (string): The email address of the user attempting to log in.
- **ipAddress** (string): The IP address from which the login attempt is made.

#### Response Format
The response will be a JSON object containing the threat level score:

```json
{
  "threatLevel": 30
}
```

- **threatLevel** (integer): The calculated threat level based on the assessment criteria. A higher score indicates a higher risk.

#### Example Usage
To assess the risk level for a user, send a POST request to the `/risk-assessment` endpoint with the required parameters.

**Request Example:**
```
POST /risk-assessment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
}
```

**Response Example:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "threatLevel": 30
}
```

## Error Handling
In case of an error, the API will return an appropriate HTTP status code along with a message detailing the issue.

### Possible Error Responses
- **400 Bad Request**: If the request is malformed or missing required fields.
- **404 Not Found**: If the user with the specified email does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: If an unexpected error occurs during processing.

## Conclusion
The Risk Assessment API is a crucial component for enhancing security during user authentication. By evaluating various risk factors, it helps in identifying potentially fraudulent login attempts and taking necessary actions to protect user accounts.
